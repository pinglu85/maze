# Maze Generator & Solver Visualizer

This is a web application built with vanilla JavaScript and is used to visualize maze algorithms and pathfinding algorithms. I built this application because I was fascinated by these algorithms and also wanted to improve my Front-End skills. You can access it here: https://pinglu85.github.io/maze/

## Maze Algorithms

This application includes the following maze algorithms:

- **Hunt-and-Kill**: produces mazes that have long, twisty passages and relatively few dead ends.

- **Recursive Backtracker**: produces mazes that have long, twisty passages and relatively few dead ends; much faster than Hunt-and-Kill.

- **Recursive Division**: a fast algorithm; builds walls, rather than breaking through them.

- **Growing Tree**: depends heavily on how the next cell is selected from the set.

- **Binary Tree**: produces mazes that have a very biased texture.

- **Randomized Kruskal's Algorithm**: produces very regular, uniform mazes; largely unbiased.

- **Aldous-Broder Algorithm**: one of the least efficient maze algorithms; unbiased.

## Pathfinding Algorithms

This application includes the following pathfinding algorithms:

- **Dijkstra's Algorithm**: the classic pathfinding algorithm; guarantees the shortest path.

- **A\* Search**: one of the best pathfinding algorithm; uses heuristics to guarantee the shortest path; much faster than Dijkstra's Algorithm.
